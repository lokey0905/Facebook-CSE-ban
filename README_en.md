## My Appeal Letter (Chinese & English Templates)

### 📧 English Version (originally written in Chinese and translated into English by AI)

**Subject:** Request for Review and Restoration of My Facebook Account

```

Dear Facebook and Meta Team,

I am a Facebook user, [用戶名] ([account ID]). My account was permanently disabled on May 21, 2025, for allegedly violating policies related to CSE. I was extremely surprised and distressed to find my account disabled for this reason, as I have never uploaded, shared, or participated in any content or activities that violate this policy.

I suspect this may have been caused by an AI detection error or misunderstanding. I sincerely request your team to thoroughly review my account. I am more than willing to provide my identification or any other information necessary to confirm that this is a wrongful action.

If your review team requires any further information or clarification from me, I am fully prepared to cooperate and provide any needed explanations or improvements. Please allow me the opportunity to correct any misunderstanding and retain my account.

Currently, I am unable to log in to my account, which has caused significant disruption to my life and work. I kindly ask for your assistance in reviewing and lifting the ban.

Additionally, based on the data I downloaded, my Facebook account had several foreign IP login records on 5/15, 5/06, 2/25, 2/18, and 2/17 this year. It is possible that my account was hacked, which may have led to the suspension.

I have also tried to contact customer service through Instagram's Meta Pro issue [case number], but have not received any response since June 17, nor am I able to open a new case. Although Meta Pro advertises 24-hour customer support, I have not received any reply for over a week. I sincerely hope your support team can review and process my case as soon as possible.

I understand that the number of cases may be high recently. Thank you very much for your understanding and assistance, and I look forward to your reply.

Wishing you peace and well-being,  
[Your Name]

**主旨：懇請協助審查並恢復我的 Facebook 帳號**

```

Facebook與Meta團隊 您好：

我是 Facebook 用戶 [用戶名] ([帳號ID])。我的帳號於 2025/5/21 因涉嫌違反兒童性剝削政策而被永久停權。得知此消息我感到非常驚訝與沮喪，因為我從未上傳、分享或參與任何違反此政策的內容或行為。

我懷疑這可能是 AI 自動偵測錯誤或誤解導致，懇請您的團隊能徹底審查我的帳號。若需要，我非常願意提供身份證明或任何其他資訊，以證明這次停權為誤判。

若審核單位有任何需要我配合改善或補充說明之處，我也會全力協助，懇請給予我改正與保留帳號的機會。

目前該帳號已無法登入，對我的生活和工作造成很大影響，懇請協助檢視並解除封鎖。

此外，根據我下載的資料，我的 Facebook 帳號在 5/15、5/06、2/25、2/18、2/17 有多筆來自國外 IP 的登入紀錄，不排除是駭客入侵導致帳號異常被停權。

我也曾透過 Instagram 的 Meta Pro 聯繫客服 編號 [編號]，但自 6/17 起未獲回覆，也無法開啟新案件。Meta Pro 廣告上標榜 24 小時專人客服，但已超過一週未獲回應，懇請支援團隊盡快審核與處理我的案件。

我理解近期案件量較大，非常感謝您的協助與理解，期待您的回覆。

祝 平安順心  
[姓名]
